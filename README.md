# Cabina da cudeschs

Cabina da cudeschs (book cabin) is a project started in 2016 to repurpose 
an old telephone booth in Guarda, Engadin (Switzerland) into a public, multilingual micro-library. Locals and 
guests are invited to take a book or leave one at any time of day or night. In addition, 
the Cabina is at the center of several literary events each year.

The project is realized by:

* Flurina Badel
* Sybil Ehrensberger
* Viviane Ehrensberger
* Yvonne Ehrensberger
* Jérémie Sarbach
* Luca Zogg
